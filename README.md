# Repository for social pursuit dataset analysis (2019). 

The goal of this project will be to characterize and quantify pursuit behaviors between two adult female mice, cohoused together over extended periods of time (~1 week). We will develop pipelines to extract behavioral traces from this dataset, and quantify the kinds of social behaviors that emerge.
