Use lda to capture patterns of behavior that are stable over time per individual

Patterns are stable, but the constituent behaviors might not be.

1 day of activation: more contact, less time outside
2 days of activation: chasing, higher velocity. 

Paradigm of head-to-head vs. head-to-tail interactions. 

cite other articles mentioned here: shemesh (complex group interactions between more than two mice), forkosh (individual mouse personalities)


It might be worthwhile to consider other behavioral paradigm classifications that have been used in the past. A set of IDs (Forkosh), A set of behaviors (Shemesh), head to head vs. head to tail. },
